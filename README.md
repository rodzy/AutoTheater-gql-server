2. `clone` your `fork` into your local machine.
3. `cd autotheater-gql-server` on your terminal.
4. Run `yarn install` on your terminal to get all the dependencies used.
5. Setup your database environment keep in mind that this server was made using PostgreSQL in mind <br> Create a `.env` file as the following
   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=autotheatergql
   DB_USERNAME= <your-username>
   DB_PASSWORD= <password>
   ```

7. Run `yarn watch` to compile all the `*.ts` files into `*.js`.
8. Run `yarn dev`, and you're ready to go server must be online on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

## Scripts

This project uses TypeScript watch to compile the code to JavaScript for a faster load time and better optimazation for *production*

The npm scripts:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "watch":"tsc -w",
    "dev":"nodemon dist/index.js",
    "dev:ts":"nodemon --exec src/index.ts",
    "start":"node dist/index.js",
    "start:ts":"ts-node src/index.ts"
  },
```

> Keep in mind that using dev:ts will be slower because of the re-compiling step
